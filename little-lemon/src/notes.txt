What did I misunderstand about the useReducer/availableTimes issue?

I did not understand how to use useReducer to track available times with state based on previous bookings.

I thought they wanted me to use useReducer to:
1: keep track of all bookings submitted;
2: keep track of all available times for each date based on #1.

This seemed difficult to me, and seemed like something a DB should handle as not everyone would be working off the same session-specific state.

Now I understand, they don't care about that.

They want the date change to trigger an API call which will produce a randomly-populated array of availableTimes each time the date is changed.

They really just wanted you to use useReducer to track...uh...wait.

I'm actually still confused.

Why are we using useReducer to track available times if they'll always be randomly populated?

WHAT IS USEREDUCER FOR IN THIS

Hm.

Still working on it.
